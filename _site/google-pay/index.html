            <h2>Problem statement</h2>
            <p>When users are doing P2P payments, the success status stays for about 2 seconds. If the merchant is busy tending to his other customers, users miss the 2-second window there is and have to navigate down to <b>All Transactions</b>.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-group">
            <h2>User flow</h2>
            <p>My goal with user flows was to draw out the existing "work-around" users are doing. Later user flows are guiding light for building wireframes and UI in next steps.</p>

            <h2>Wireframe</h2>
            <p>I added some quick ideas to explore the breadth of approaches I can move forward with. The idea was to think 4 solutions before finalizing one in the head.</p>

            <h2>UI design</h2>
            <h4>First approach: Introducing a card with the payment details</h4>
            <p>My thoughts:
                <ul>
                <li>It can be missed by the user as it doesn't grab much attention.</li>
                <li>Not clear and intuitive enough.</li>
                <li>Involves another step of clicking on the arrow icon if more details of the payment are required.</li>
            </ul></p>
        </div>

        <div class="image-group">
            <img src="./images/gopay-1.png" alt="">
            <p class="caption text-center">Add screenshot without any gaps here.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-group">
            <div class="quote">
                <p>The pros of both the card and popup design involve mentioning the payment details right after a payment is done. Both the designs, to an extent, add an additional step of going into “All transactions” to check the payment information in detail.</p>
            </div>
        </div>


        <div class="content-group mt-medium">
            <h4>Third approach: Turning the entire screen into a success status</h4>
            <p>My thoughts:
                <ul>
                <li>It doesn't go away unless clicked on “Done” thereby solving the user problem.</li>
                <li>Continues the usage of existing delightful interaction</li>
                <li>The “Done” button is very intuitive making the user experience easier compared to the other two options.</li>
            </ul></p>
        </div>

        <div class="image-group">
            <img src="./images/gopay-3.png" alt="">
            
        </div>
        
        <div class="content-group mt-medium">
            <h4>Fourth approach: Adding animation and detailed payment information</h4>
            <p>My thoughts:
                <ul>
                <li>It provides a strong delightful experience by adding a “Payment Successful” animation.</li>
                <li>Automatically takes to another screen with much more detailed payment information.</li>
            </ul></p>
        </div>

        <div class="image-group">
            <img src="./images/gopay-4.png" alt="">
        </div>

        <div class="content-group mt-medium">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Showing the payment details upfront and across the entire screen makes the payment experience a lot easier for the user. Hence, both the third and fourth design is a good solution to the problem. One of the ways of measuring success would be observing changes in user journey in sessions where users pay and go into transaction history. There should be a drop in this user journey.</p>
